### Background and Overview 

Stock metrics is a data visualization application of displaying various stock metrics over different timeframes. These are metrics that investors watch and would find useful to track over time. 

### Functionality and MVPs

In Stock Metrics, users will be able to:
- Render data from IEX Cloud 
  - Besides price changes over time, to display Price to Earnings Ratio, Price to Sales Ratio, and Enterprise Value to EBITDA Ratio overlayed over the pricing chart.
- Search via stock ticker symbol.
- Have chart render with transition effects using D3. 

In addition, this project will include:
- An About section to explain the metrics plus how to use the app.
- Benchmarks added to the chart, to compare price performance for a particular stock to a benchmarks like the S&P500.
